    "text": "What do I mean?…Goals for 2023!\nI’ve always had a love/hate relationship with goal setting. I love to do it because it pours fuel on my ambitions. I hate it because I fear failure and get overwhelmed at the prospect of not being able to achieve what I want. In the interest of trying to overcome the latter while cultivating the former (showing my work!), I wanted to list out what my goals are for this year and update the post as I progress throughout 2023.\n\nSchool\n\nFinish my first doc.\n\nCentered around experimental work on directed forgetting.\nCurrently writing the introduction and literature review while also fielding a final experiment to analyze and report out on.\n\nSubmit 2 papers for review.\n\nFirst doc will be converted into a submittable paper.\nSecond paper topic ideas: memory for time, memory for perceptual detail, directed forgetting of audio-based stimuli.\n\nPresent at Psychonomics.\n\nPresented a poster in 2022.\n\nAttend (and hopefully present) at another conference.\nSubmit an additional grant/fellowship proposal.\n\nAlready submitted a proposal for the Doctoral Student Research Grant through CUNY.\n\n\n\n\nWork\n\nWrite 2 white papers.\n\nCurrently working on a methodology for determining minimum thresholds for KPI reporting using Bayesian power analysis techniques.\nHave two main ideas for an additional project: anomally detection using Bayesian online changepoint detection, investigate if subject perception of visual features of a text-to-image generated picture aligns with the keywords used to create it.\n\nCompletely 2 large scale end-to-end projects.\n\nSee above bullet.\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Research\n\nBuild forex trading bot.\nBuild 2 models (transformer and stable diffusion).\nBuild a recommender system.\nCollaborate on at least 1 open source project.\nInvest time into the Cohere Community.\n\n\n\nPhotography\n\nFinish my 2022 photo book.\n\nAlmost done!\n\nInvest in a brand new camera.\n\nNikon Z8…please come out soon.\n\nTake on at least 1 portraiture project.\nSubmit to 2 competitions."

In case you haven’t checked out my About page yet, let me tell you a little bit about me.\nMy name is Drew and I am a PhD candidate at The Graduate Center, CUNY studying cognitive psychology in the Cognitive & Comparative Psychology program. I am also a Senior Data Scientist at Zenith Media trying to better understand and analyze the effects of advertising. In my free time, I am an avid photographer, music enthusiast, and general supporter of creative pursuits — I am fortunate to have studied classical piano under Dr. Min Kwon and worked as a cook in Michelin-starred restaurants throughout NYC. Most importantly, I am the loving partner of Andy (and hopeful future pug parent)."

    "text": "why start blogging?\nAs someone who finds talking about themselves and their pursuits to be difficult, I often asked myself, “Why start blogging?” in the lead up to writing this. I am terrible about making social media updates. I have an already packed schedule and several pages of to-dos. And I generally struggle with putting myself out there. Why do this at all?\nIn most of my endeavors, I do a majority of my work behind the scenes. Rarely have I or do I explain how the sausage is made, and for a while I liked it that way. That all changed after (1) talking with Andy more about the importance of having a living document of work to show others and (2) reading “Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered” by Austin Kleon. I realized (through much help/cajoling) that I had to shift my perspective away from thinking about sharing as self-promotion and more towards showing my work. Rather than being another faceless, nameless person swimming with the tide, I want to create something that embodies who I am, what I have accomplished, and my plans for the future."

    "text": "future blog plans\n\nLearning Agenda\nI entered into my PhD program with the goal of becoming a researcher working at the intersections of artificial intelligence and cognition. About 1.5 years into my program, however, I realized that a PhD in cognitive psychology is not going to be enough — I have to also be approaching projects from the AI side as well. So I set about thinking through what AI domains I want to learn more about:\n\nTransformers and attention\nDiffusion models\nRecommender systems\nAlgorithmic financial trading\nBayesian statistics\n\nAnd also which domains in cognition:\n\nModels of memory and attention\nPerceptions of time and its effect on memory\nBayesian applications to cognitive psychology\nMore generally, how to plan, organize, and execute a long-term research agenda\n\nIn order to become acquainted with the above, particularly the AI-based domains, I plan on using four month “sprints” for each. The beginning period (one month to six weeks) will focus primarily on the conceptual — how does this work, what is the high level overview, and what are the technical aspects. The remaining stretch will be spent building a project/application/etc. focused on practically applying previously acquired knowledge.\n\nUpdates and Posts\nBut what does all that mean for a blog? Posts, posts, and more posts! I am aiming to make routine updates around:\n\nPaper recaps on CogSci and AI topics (hoping to post once a week to every two weeks while rotating between the two domains)\nAttempts to explain a method or topic conceptually (once a month at most)\nCoding problem solutions (once every couple of weeks)\nProject and research updates (both for my PhD and independent research)\nProject conclusion posts featuring code and hopefully working applications/examples.\n\nAs well as ad hoc posts when inspiration strikes (e.g., photo drops to the Gallery).\n\n\n\nVlog???\nI’ve toyed around with the idea of starting a video component to my blog, but am unsure if I want to commit to it now. If things go well with updating a blog regularly, I’ll consider a vlog more thoroughly. Feel free to reach out via email if you have any strong feelings one way or another."
