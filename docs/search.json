    "text": "I think it’s important to say that first — it is a cornerstone of who I am.\n\n\n\nI was born on the coast of Korea and subsequently raised on the New Jersey shore. Peak childhood coincided with the airing of “Rocket Power” on Nickelodeon all but ensuring that I would fall in love with surfing, hockey, and the ocean. Even now, summer isn’t summer without trips home to LBI to enjoy the sun, sand, and sea.\n\n\n\nI am passionate about creative expression — both my own pursuits and encouraging others.\nIn my free time, I am an amateur photographer shooting under my birth name, Kim Jung Ha (김정하), where I focus on trying to capture individuals at their most vulnerable and honest. Check out my Gallery page for my work and feel free to contact me with any inquiries.\nI also proudly served on the steering committee for the Korean American Artist Collective, a group of artists dedicated to supporting, building, and amplifying works that are politically, socially, and culturally engaged, and rooted in the Korean American experience."
