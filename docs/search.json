In case you haven’t checked out my About page yet, let me tell you a little bit about me.\nMy name is Drew and I am a PhD candidate at The Graduate Center, CUNY studying cognitive psychology in the Cognitive & Comparative Psychology program. I am also a Senior Data Scientist at Zenith Media trying to better understand and analyze the effects of advertising. In my free time, I am an avid photographer, music enthusiast, and general supporter of creative pursuits — I am fortunate to have studied classical piano under Dr. Min Kwon and worked as a cook in Michelin-starred restaurants throughout NYC. Most importantly, I am the loving partner of Andy (and hopeful future pug parent)."

    "text": "I think it’s important to say that first — it is a cornerstone of who I am.\n\n\n\nI was born on the coast of Korea and subsequently raised on the New Jersey shore. Peak childhood coincided with the airing of “Rocket Power” on Nickelodeon all but ensuring that I would fall in love with surfing, hockey, and the ocean. Even now, summer isn’t summer without trips home to LBI to enjoy the sun, sand, and sea.\n\n\n\nI am passionate about creative expression — both my own pursuits and encouraging others.\nIn my free time, I am an amateur photographer shooting under my birth name, Kim Jung Ha (김정하), where I focus on trying to capture individuals at their most vulnerable and honest. Check out my Gallery page for my work and feel free to contact me with any inquiries.\nI also proudly served on the steering committee for the Korean American Artist Collective, a group of artists dedicated to supporting, building, and amplifying works that are politically, socially, and culturally engaged, and rooted in the Korean American experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUG!{text-align=“center”}"
