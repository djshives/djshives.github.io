### welcome!

Hello to new and old followers! In case you haven't checked out my [About](https://djshives.github.io/about.html) page yet, let me tell you a little bit about me.

My name is Drew and I am a PhD candidate at The Graduate Center, CUNY studying cognitive psychology in the Cognitive & Comparative Psychology program. I am also a Senior Data Scientist at Zenith Media trying to better understand and analyze the effects of advertising. In my free time, I am an avid photographer, music enthusiast, and general supporter of creative pursuits --- I am fortunate to have studied classical piano under Dr. Min Kwon and worked as a cook in Michelin-starred restaurants throughout NYC. Most importantly, I am the loving partner of Andy (and hopeful future pug parent).

### why start blogging?

As someone who finds talking about themselves and their pursuits to be difficult, I often asked myself, "Why start blogging?" in the lead up to writing this. I am terrible about making social media updates. I have an already packed schedule and several pages of to-dos. And I generally struggle with putting myself out there. Why do this at all?

In most of my endeavors, I do a majority of my work behind the scenes. Rarely have I or do I explain how the sausage is made, and for a while I liked it that way. That all changed after (1) talking with Andy more about the importance of having a living document of work to show others and (2) reading "Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered" by Austin Kleon. I realized (through much help/cajoling) that I had to shift my perspective away from thinking about sharing as self-promotion and more towards showing my work. Rather than being another faceless, nameless person swimming with the tide, I want to create something that embodies who I am, what I have accomplished, and my plans for the future.

### future blog plans

#### Learning Agenda

I entered into my PhD program with the goal of becoming a researcher working at the intersections of artificial intelligence and cognition. About 1.5 years into my program, however, I realized that a PhD in cognitive psychology is not going to be enough --- I have to also be approaching projects from the AI side as well. So I set about thinking through what AI domains I want to learn more about:

-   Transformers and attention
-   Diffusion models
-   Recommender systems
-   Algorithmic financial trading
-   Bayesian statistics

And also which domains in cognition:

-   Models of memory and attention
-   Perceptions of time and its effect on memory
-   Bayesian applications to cognitive psychology
-   More generally, how to plan, organize, and execute a long-term research agenda

In order to become acquainted with the above, particularly the AI-based domains, I plan on using four month "sprints" for each. The beginning period (one month to six weeks) will focus primarily on the conceptual --- how does this work, what is the high level overview, and what are the technical aspects. The remaining stretch will be spent building a project/application/etc. focused on practically applying previously acquired knowledge.

##### Updates and Posts

But what does all that mean for a blog? Posts, posts, and more posts! I am aiming to make routine updates around:

-   Paper recaps on CogSci and AI topics (hoping to post once a week to every two weeks while rotating between the two domains)
-   Attempts to explain a method or topic conceptually (once a month at most)
-   Coding problem solutions (once every couple of weeks)
-   Project and research updates (both for my PhD and independent research)
-   Project conclusion posts featuring code and hopefully working applications/examples.

As well as ad hoc posts when inspiration strikes (e.g., photo drops to the [Gallery](https://djshives.github.io/gallery.html)).

#### Vlog???

I've toyed around with the idea of starting a video component to my blog, but am unsure if I want to commit to it now. If things go well with updating a blog regularly, I'll consider a vlog more thoroughly. Feel free to reach out [via email](mailto:djshives@gmail.com) if you have any strong feelings one way or another.

## Thanks for Coming and Stay Tuned!
