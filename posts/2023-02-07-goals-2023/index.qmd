## A recent conversation with myself,

-   "Wait, 2023 started already?"
-   Yep, it's already February.
-   "Uh...I thought we wanted to get a jump on this year?"
-   Fortunately, we already have!
-   "That's great!...What do you mean?"

## What do I mean?...Goals for 2023!

I've always had a love/hate relationship with goal setting. I love to do it because it pours fuel on my ambitions. I hate it because I fear failure and get overwhelmed at the prospect of not being able to achieve what I want. In the interest of trying to overcome the latter while cultivating the former (showing my work!), I wanted to list out what my goals are for this year and update the post as I progress throughout 2023. 

### School

- Finish my first doc.
  - Centered around experimental work on directed forgetting.
  - Currently writing the introduction and literature review while also fielding a final experiment to analyze and report out on.
- Submit 2 papers for review.
  - First doc will be converted into a submittable paper.
  - Second paper topic ideas: memory for time, memory for perceptual detail, directed forgetting of audio-based stimuli. 
- Present at Psychonomics.
  - Presented a poster in 2022.
- Attend (and hopefully present) at another conference.
- Submit an additional grant/fellowship proposal.
  - Already submitted a proposal for the Doctoral Student Research Grant through CUNY.

### Work

- Write 2 white papers.
  - Currently working on a methodology for determining minimum thresholds for KPI reporting using Bayesian power analysis techniques.
  - Have two main ideas for an additional project: anomally detection using Bayesian online changepoint detection, investigate if subject perception of visual features of a text-to-image generated picture aligns with the keywords used to create it.
- Completely 2 large scale end-to-end projects.
  - See above bullet.

### Personal Research
