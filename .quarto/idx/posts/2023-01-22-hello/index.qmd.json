In case you haven't checked out my [About](https://djshives.github.io/about.html) page yet, let me tell you a little bit about me.\n\nMy name is Drew and I am a PhD candidate at The Graduate Center, CUNY studying cognitive psychology in the Cognitive & Comparative Psychology program. I am also a Senior Data Scientist at Zenith Media trying to better understand and analyze the effects of advertising. In my free time, I am an avid photographer, music enthusiast, and general supporter of creative pursuits --- I am fortunate to have studied classical piano under Dr. Min Kwon and worked as a cook in Michelin-starred restaurants throughout NYC. Most importantly, I am the loving partner of Andy (and hopeful future pug parent).\n\n## why start blogging?\n\nAs someone who finds talking about themselves and their pursuits to be difficult, I often asked myself, \"Why start blogging?\" in the lead up to writing this. I am terrible about making social media updates. I have an already packed schedule and several pages of to-dos. And I generally struggle with putting myself out there. Why do this at all?\n\nIn most of my endeavors, I do a majority of my work behind the scenes. Rarely have I or do I explain how the sausage is made, and for a while I liked it that way. That all changed after (1) talking with Andy more about the importance of having a living document of work to show others and (2) reading \"Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered\" by Austin Kleon. I realized (through much help/cajoling) that I had to shift my perspective away from thinking about sharing as self-promotion and more towards showing my work. Rather than being another faceless, nameless person swimming with the tide, I want to create something that embodies who I am, what I have accomplished, and my plans for the future.\n\n## future blog plans\n\n### Learning Agenda\n\nI entered into my PhD program with the goal of becoming a researcher working at the intersections of artificial intelligence and cognition. About 1.5 years into my program, however, I realized that a PhD in cognitive psychology is not going to be enough --- I have to also be approaching projects from the AI side as well. So I set about thinking through what AI domains I want to learn more about:\n\n-   Transformers and attention\n-   Diffusion models\n-   Recommender systems\n-   Algorithmic financial trading\n-   Bayesian statistics\n\nAnd also which domains in cognition:\n\n-   Models of memory and attention\n-   Perceptions of time and its effect on memory\n-   Bayesian applications to cognitive psychology\n-   More generally, how to plan, organize, and execute a long-term research agenda\n\nIn order to become acquainted with the above, particularly the AI-based domains, I plan on using four month \"sprints\" for each. The beginning period (one month to six weeks) will focus primarily on the conceptual --- how does this work, what is the high level overview, and what are the technical aspects. The remaining stretch will be spent building a project/application/etc. focused on practically applying previously acquired knowledge.\n\n#### Updates and Posts\n\nBut what does all that mean for a blog? Posts, posts, and more posts! I am aiming to make routine updates around:\n\n-   Paper recaps on CogSci and AI topics (hoping to post once a week to every two weeks while rotating between the two domains)\n-   Attempts to explain a method or topic conceptually (once a month at most)\n-   Coding problem solutions (once every couple of weeks)\n-   Project and research updates (both for my PhD and independent research)\n-   Project conclusion posts featuring code and hopefully working applications/examples.\n\nAs well as ad hoc posts when inspiration strikes (e.g., photo drops to the [Gallery](https://djshives.github.io/gallery.html)).\n\n### Vlog???\n\nI've toyed around with the idea of starting a video component to my blog, but am unsure if I want to commit to it now. If things go well with updating a blog regularly, I'll consider a vlog more thoroughly.
