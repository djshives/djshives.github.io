Peak childhood coincided with the airing of \"Rocket Power\" on Nickelodeon all but ensuring that I would fall in love with surfing, hockey, and the ocean. Even now, summer isn't summer without trips home to LBI to enjoy the sun, sand, and sea.\n\n### I love participating in and promoting the arts\n\nI am passionate about creative expression --- both my own pursuits and encouraging others.\n\nIn my free time, I am an amateur photographer shooting under my birth name, Kim Jung Ha (김정하), where I focus on trying to capture individuals at their most vulnerable and honest. Check out my [Gallery](https://djshives.github.io/gallery.html) page for my work and feel free to [contact me](mailto:djshives@gmail.com) with any inquiries.\n\nI also proudly served on the steering committee for the [Korean American Artist Collective](https://www.kaacollective.com/), a group of artists dedicated to supporting, building, and amplifying works that are politically, socially, and culturally engaged, and rooted in the Korean American experience.\n\n### I love pugs\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/dog-pug.gif\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/dog-pug.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## research\n\n## work\n",
