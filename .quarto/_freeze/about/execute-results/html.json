Peak childhood coincided with the airing of \"Rocket Power\" on Nickelodeon all but ensuring that I would fall in love with surfing, hockey, and the ocean. Even now, summer isn't summer without trips home to LBI to enjoy the sun, sand, and sea.\n\n### I love participating in and promoting the arts\n\nI am passionate about creative expression --- both my own pursuits and encouraging others.\n\nIn my free time, I am an amateur photographer shooting under my birth name, Kim Jung Ha (김정하), where I focus on trying to capture individuals at their most vulnerable and honest. Check out my [Gallery](https://djshives.github.io/gallery.html) page for my work and feel free to [contact me](mailto:djshives@gmail.com) with any inquiries.\n\nI also proudly served on the steering committee for the [Korean American Artist Collective](https://www.kaacollective.com/), a group of artists dedicated to supporting, building, and amplifying works that are politically, socially, and culturally engaged, and rooted in the Korean American experience.\n\n### I love pugs\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/dog-pug.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## research\n\n### PhD\n\nI am a PhD candidate at The Graduate Center, CUNY studying under [Dr. Matthew Crump](http://crumplab.com/). My work focuses on understanding human cognition, specifically memory, attention, and decision making, along computational terms.\n\n### Independent\n\nBeyond conducting research for school, I have general interests in AI/ML and statistics. Specifically:\n\n-   Transformers and attention-based models\n-   Bayesian statistics\n-   Recommender systems\n\n## work\n\n### Data Science\n\nAlong with pursuing a PhD, I am also a Senior Data Scientist at [Zenith Media](https://www.zenithmedia.com/). Previously, I was a Data Scientist at [Marina Maher Communications](https://hellommc.com/) and a Senior Analyst in the Marketing Analytics department of [Kepler Group](https://www.keplergrp.com/).\n\n### Previous experience\n\nPrior to my career in data science, I was a fine dining cook working in some of Manahattan and Brooklyn's finest kitchens. Some highlights include [ABC Kitchen](https://www.abckitchens.nyc/), [Alder](https://www.instagram.com/aldernyc/?hl=en), and [Gabriel Kreuther](https://www.gknyc.com/).\n",
