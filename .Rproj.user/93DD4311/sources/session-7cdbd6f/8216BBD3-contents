## life

### I am a Korean adoptee

I think it's important to say that first --- it is a cornerstone of who I am.

### I am a beach bum at heart

I was born on the coast of Korea and subsequently raised on the New Jersey shore. Peak childhood coincided with the airing of "Rocket Power" on Nickelodeon all but ensuring that I would fall in love with surfing, hockey, and the ocean. Even now, summer isn't summer without trips home to LBI to enjoy the sun, sand, and sea.

### I love participating in and promoting the arts

I am passionate about creative expression --- both my own pursuits and encouraging others.

In my free time, I am an amateur photographer shooting under my birth name, Kim Jung Ha (김정하), where I focus on trying to capture individuals at their most vulnerable and honest. Check out my [Gallery](https://djshives.github.io/gallery.html) page for my work and feel free to [contact me](mailto:djshives@gmail.com) with any inquiries.

I also proudly served on the steering committee for the [Korean American Artist Collective](https://www.kaacollective.com/), a group of artists dedicated to supporting, building, and amplifying works that are politically, socially, and culturally engaged, and rooted in the Korean American experience.

### I love pugs

## research

### PhD

I am a PhD candidate at The Graduate Center, CUNY studying under [Dr. Matthew Crump](http://crumplab.com/). My work focuses on understanding human cognition, specifically memory, attention, and decision making, along computational terms.

### Independent

Beyond conducting research for school, I have general interests in AI/ML and statistics. Specifically:

-   Transformers and attention-based models
-   Bayesian statistics
-   Recommender systems

## work

### Data Science

Along with pursuing a PhD, I am also a Senior Data Scientist at [Zenith Media](https://www.zenithmedia.com/). Previously, I was a Data Scientist at [Marina Maher Communications](https://hellommc.com/) and a Senior Analyst in the Marketing Analytics department of [Kepler Group](https://www.keplergrp.com/).

### Previous experience

Prior to my career in data science, I was a fine dining cook working in some of Manahattan and Brooklyn's finest kitchens. Some highlights include [ABC Kitchen](https://www.abckitchens.nyc/), [Alder](https://www.instagram.com/aldernyc/?hl=en), and [Gabriel Kreuther](https://www.gknyc.com/).
